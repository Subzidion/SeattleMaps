# Overview

This project was motivated by Seattle's closed source [Gigabit Availability Map](https://www.seattle.gov/tech/initiatives/broadband/gigabit-availability). The GeoJSON powering this visualization can be found on Seattle's [Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/) [here](https://data.seattle.gov/Land-Base/Census-Tracts-2010/unjy-da86).

I'm hoping this project can be expanded to add a variety of maps, such as neighborhoods, historic maps, or election results.

## Tech Stack

This project utilizes React, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
